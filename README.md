* A live discourse forum
* You have deployed your live forum using Docker.  If you're using Digital Ocean, it's likely that your forum is deployed on Docker.

For non-docker or local development installation (those with programming experience), see **Other Installation**.


### Step 1 - Install the Official Discourse Advertising Plugin


As seen in a [how-to on meta.discourse.org](https://meta.discourse.org/t/advanced-troubleshooting-with-docker/15927#Example:%20Install%20a%20plugin), simply **add the plugin's repository url to your container's app.yml file**:

```yml
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - mkdir -p plugins
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-adplugin.git
```
Rebuild the container

```
cd /var/discourse
git pull
./launcher rebuild app
```

### Step 2 - Configure Your Settings to Display Your Advertisments

There are 2 easy steps for configuring your Discourse settings to enable advertisements to display in your Discourse forum.

#### Step 2(a) - Choose Your Advertisement Platform

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Admin section in your Discourse forum.</li>
<li>Click on Settings and a left vertical navigation bar should appear.</li>
<li>Choose your advertisement platform.</li>
<ul>
<li>Adsense - if using Adsense as your advertisement platform.</li>
<li>DFP - if using the DoubleClick for Publishers advertisement platform.</li>
<li>CodeFund - if using the CodeFund ethical advertisement platform.</li>
<li>Carbon Ads - if using the Carbon Ads advertisement platform.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

#### Step 2(b) - Input Your Details

1. Add in your publisher ID - your publisher ID can be obtained from your ad platform and can also be found in your ad tag (see pictures below).
2. Choose your trust level from the dropdown box.  This will only display ads to users with a certain level of trust.  For more details about trust levels go to the **Plugin Features** heading.
3. Get the Advertisement Tag from your Ad Platform - see the images below to see what a tag looks like.
4. Add parts of your ad code to Discourse's site settings for the locations you wish your ad to appear.  Refer to image for your ad platform to where parts of your ad tag should go.  For more detail about where the ad will appear
5. Choose Your Ad Size - this is the same size that you've put into your ad provider to create your ad.  Go to the **Plugin Features** heading to see a list of supported Ad sizes.

### Step 3 - See Your Ad

### Available Locations for Ad Display

The following are available locations along with a description and an image showing their location within Discourse to display ads for all platforms.

| Topic Above Post Stream | Ad will appear in the header of all Discourse forum topics |
| Topic Above Suggested | Ad will appear in the footer above suggested topics of all Discourse forum topics |
| Post Bottom & Nth Post | Ad will appear on the stipulated nth post within a topic.  So if you have 5 posts in a topic and you want the ad to display after on the 2nd post, put 2 in ```ad_platform_nth_post_code```. |
